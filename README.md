# üéÆ GAME PROGRAMMING LAB
This repository contains the implementation of various **Game Programming Lab experiments** using **Unity** and **C# scripting**, covering 3D model building, tile-based systems, beginner scripting, game mechanics, lighting, audio, and VR simulations.  

---

## üìÇ Lab Experiments

### **Lab 1: 3D Model Building in Unity**
- Create a simple 3D model using planes and blocks.
- Build a house-like structure with roof and side walls.
- Add a car object to represent a garage environment.

---

### **Lab 2: Tile-Based Grid System & Object Merging**
1. **Tile-Based Grid Construction**
   - Create a tile palette
   - Import sprite sheets
   - Slice and generate tiles for grid-based maps  
2. **Merging Mechanism**
   - Demonstrated with axe and target board
   - Implemented with a **C# script (AxeTargetMerge.cs)**
3. **Space Management**
   - Collider2D & Rigidbody2D setup
   - Composite Collider for improved physics

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Unity** (2D & 3D Game Development)
- **C# Scripting**
- Unity Asset Store Packages (Fruits, Audio, VR SDKs)
- Visual Studio Code (with C# Dev Kit Extension)

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Open **Unity Hub** and create/import the project.  
2. Ensure the required **Unity version** (2019.3 or above).  
3. Import assets & scripts from respective lab folders.  
4. Run the Unity scene for each lab.
